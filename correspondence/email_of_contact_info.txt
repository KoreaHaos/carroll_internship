Dr. K. McMahon,
Professor Park,

As required, i am submitting contact info for one of my Internship Supervisors here at Ewha.

Although Ms. HaYeon would technically be my ‘direct’ supervisor, Professor Park is currently my main contact. I intend to speak with Ms. HaYeon as soon as possible and see if this task would be something she would entertain. Technically, since i am the only ‘intern’ in the office, everyone here could consider themselves a supervisor. I will see what i can do about cajoling them into offering a review.

I have also included my goals statement, and for Pr. Park, a copy of the syllabus.

As more documents are created, i will forward them to you both.

Thank you both for your work and know that i look forward to completing this long awaited, and somewhat overdue, portion of my studies.

Sincerely,

Benjamin Haos
