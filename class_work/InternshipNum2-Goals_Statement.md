Goals Statement</p>

<p align="center">
Numerous, Nebulous, NonLinear ...</p> 

<p>Internshipment with Ewha Womans' Embedded Software Research Lab is fully unexpected and far exceeds my well-documented wildest imaginations. Eclipsing clicheic obtainment of work experience, i will realize a sought after opportunity of exposure and immersion in epistemic community as far removed from my own as possible. Leveraging the countless gifts of knowledge Carroll University has bestowed onto me, i will broaden my scope of exposure, complete several long-term projects, and perhaps release a bit of research.</p>
